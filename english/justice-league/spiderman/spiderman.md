Your friendly neighbourhood spiderman is here to help!!

"GET DOWN!"

Spiderman lunges forward and tackles you to the ground.
A dark figure darts from building to building, but it's moving so fast you 
can barely keep track of it.
Then you cry.  An ugly uncomfortable cry.  Spiderman leaves.  Ashamed of you.
